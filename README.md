# Augnote: Tag / Bookmark Manager
## Description
Do you prefer making handwritten notes?
But don't like how you can't link images, videos or documents to them.

Augnote can help you with that.

- Create Tags/Bookmarks of Photos, Videos, Audio, URL or any document you want.
- Write this tag/bookmark in your notes and search for it when you need it.
- Create as many folder or sub folders you want to organise your tags/bookmarks
